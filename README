Epubtools takes as input a series of chapters in a supported format and outputs
a valid EPUB-2 e-book. Note that if you run epubcheck on the result, you'll get
the following two errors:

ERROR: attribute "opf:role" not allowed here; expected attribute "dir" or "xml:lang"
ERROR: attribute "opf:file-as" not allowed here; expected attribute "dir" or "xml:lang"

This is not because it's an invalid EPUB-2 file. For an explanation of the issue,
See: https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/issues/467

This package requires Python 3.x or above.
